# voice-analyzer
A simple voice pitch analyzer intended to assist trans people in developing voices that they like.

Forked by me (@mccartykim) to see if I could add some graphing and modal frequency analysis.

I've added a basic modal graph, in hopes that I figure out what an issue on another repo wanted.  The modal frequency chart seems to work, although I'm not quite sure I understood the definition in a speech pathology setting.
